PLAGUE - CHINA (03): (GANSU) PNEUMONIC, FATALITY

Gansu Health and Family Planning Commission officially reported on 17
Oct 2014 that the Gansu Subei Mongolian Autonomous County People's
Hospital confirmed a case of plague. The patient was from Sangewa
Ranch in Machang Village of Dangchengwan Township in Subei County. The
patient had fever and shortness of breath before passing away.

The report stated that on 15 Oct 2014, Jiuquan City Health Bureau
reported [the case as] suspected plague. The patient was a male, Han
Chinese, 50-year old rancher. On 16 Oct 2014, experts from national,
provincial, city, and county levels confirmed pneumonic plague based
on clinical symptoms, epidemiological history, and lab test results.
No abnormalities have been observed in 22 contacts.

[Most plague cases are due to the bubonic form following the bite of
an infected rodent flea causing a swollen and very tender lymph gland.
The swollen gland is called a "bubo." Bubonic plague should be
suspected when a person develops a swollen gland, fever, chills,
headache, and extreme exhaustion, and has a history of possible
exposure to infected rodents, rabbits, or fleas. A person usually
becomes ill with bubonic plague 2 to 6 days after being bitten.

When bubonic plague is left untreated, the _Yersinia pestis_ organism
can invade the bloodstream. As the plague bacteria multiply in the
bloodstream, they spread rapidly throughout the body and cause a
severe and often fatal condition. Infection of the lungs with the
plague bacterium causes the pneumonic form of plague, a severe
respiratory illness. The infected person may experience high fever,
chills, cough, and breathing difficulty and may expel bloody sputum.
If plague patients are not given specific antibiotic therapy, the
disease can progress rapidly to death. At this stage, as appears to
have happened in this case, person-to-person spread can occur, causing
cases of "primary" plague pneumonia.

The marmot is the most common reservoir for _Yersinia pestis_ in
eastern Asia. The etymology of the term "marmot" is uncertain
(<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marmot>). It may have arisen from the
Gallo-Romance prefix marm-, meaning to mumble or murmur (an example of
onomatopoeia). Another possible origin is post-classical Latin, mus
montanus, meaning "mountain mouse." - Mod.LL
