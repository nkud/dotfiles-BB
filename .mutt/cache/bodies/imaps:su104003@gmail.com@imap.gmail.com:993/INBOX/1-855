Hello Naoki,

Wow, I'm so excited today! After more than a year of coding, brainstorming,=
 working overtime, coding even more... we are ready to show you the future =
of Nozbe and the future of productivity: Nozbe 2.0 beta

http://app.getresponse.com/click.html?x=3Da62b&lc=3Dw34W2&mc=3Dho&s=3DB7FjP=
9&u=3DhcT&y=3Dq&

**Nozbe rewritten from scratch**

After 7+ years of running Nozbe we decided to use everything we've learned =
so far about productivity and build new, mobile-friendly, super-fast, beaut=
ifully-designed apps that take advantage of both the desktop and mobile pla=
tforms.

Go to our Nozbe 2.0 beta site and watch me walk you through our new apps.

Here are some questions you might have about the Nozbe beta program and my =
best answers for you:

***What's new in Nozbe 2.0?***

* brand new fresh, light and responsive design
* much better app performance: speed, speed, speed
* edit mode - you can edit/complete/delete multiple tasks at once - one of =
our most requested features!
* 5th column (Info bar) - one place when you can see all details and option=
s regarding active task list
* filters and sorting - now you can filter your tasks list with many filter=
s at once and sort the tasks as you like
* ...and a lot more!

***Where can I get Nozbe 2.0 beta for my device?***

* **Web app + Mac, Windows and Linux** apps are available today - get them =
from our Nozbe "beta site"
* **iPhone, iPad and Android** - we'll be rolling out our mobile beta apps =
in late July, sign up for mobile beta on our Nozbe "beta site"

http://app.getresponse.com/click.html?x=3Da62b&lc=3Dw34W2&mc=3Dho&s=3DB7FjP=
9&u=3DhcT&y=3Dq&

***When will next "beta" versions be available?***

We'll be rolling out a new beta version of Nozbe every 2 weeks throughout t=
he whole Summer. Follow us on Twitter or subscribe to our blog.

***When will the final Nozbe 2.0 be launched?***

In September. We can't wait to roll it out to everyone. Up until then, Nozb=
e 1.9.x is the latest stable version of Nozbe.

***Is the Nozbe beta stable and bug-free?***

Nope. Not at all. Many things don't even work there correctly just yet. It'=
s a beta product. It's mature enough so that we can test it with our braves=
t users, but it shouldn't be used in mission-critical environment. Use it a=
t your own risk! :-)

[Read the updated list of known issues on our "beta site"

***What if I don't want to test Nozbe beta but still want to get something =
cool today?***

Easy. Get the latest issue of the free Productive! Magazine with Pat Flynn =
for your iPhone, iPad or Android or read it on the web

http://app.getresponse.com/click.html?x=3Da62b&lc=3Dw34Xh&mc=3Dho&s=3DB7FjP=
9&u=3DhcT&y=3Do&

This issue features: Pat Flynn =E2=80=94 a beloved thought leader in the ar=
eas of online entrepreneurship and passive income

plus

nine practical articles helping you get closer to a systematic and producti=
ve workflow and satisfying life.

***What are my "next actions" for today?***

Just these two things:=20

* get Nozbe 2.0 beta (and watch me walk you through it)
* get the latest Productive! Magazine

That's it, both of these things will make you a lot more productive this su=
mmer :-)

Thank you!

Yours productively,

- Michael Sliwinski

Founder and CEO, Nozbe.com

P.S. Remember, Nozbe 2.0 beta is not a finished product. We are inviting yo=
u to check it out, but we can't guarantee anything there. It's a work in pr=
ogress. We just couldn't wait any longer and keep it to ourselves. We wante=
d to show it to you today. Enjoy.
