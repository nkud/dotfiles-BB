In Dallas, Texas, health officials are keeping an eye on both [the 1st
Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital nurse infected with Ebola] and her
dog. [The nurse] is doing well. Her dog has also been quarantined for
observation. However, in Spain, a dog belonging to an Ebola patient
was euthanized. Some people worry these very different approaches to
pets may indicate that health officials still know very little about
stopping this deadly virus. [A resident] of West Springfield
[Massachusetts] told 22News, "Obviously we are doing something. Our
health system is somehow messed up. There's something going on with
miscommunication, so I'm a little scared." The Centers for Disease
Control said at this point, there have been no reports of dogs or cats
becoming sick with Ebola, or being able to spread Ebola to people.
President Barack Obama vowed Wednesday [15 Oct 2014] that his
administration would respond in a "much more aggressive way" to cases
of Ebola in the United States and warned that in an age of frequent
travel the disease could spread globally if the world doesn't respond
to the "raging epidemic in West Africa."

Texas A&M specialists advising on care of Ebola patient's dog
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
The dean of the Texas A&M College of Veterinary Medicine and
Biomedical Sciences said Wednesday [15 Oct 2014] that A&M specialists
are helping to monitor Bentley, the year-old King Charles Spaniel
owned by the 26-year-old Dallas nurse who has been hospitalized with
the Ebola virus, and will develop plans for handling Ebola-exposed
animals in the future.

Dr. Eleanor Green said at a press conference that the A&M specialists'
"role at this point has been to provide expert advice and counsel to
teams of people who are providing the best route for handling this
dog," she said. "We have been part of those discussions in determining
the best handling of this dog in addition to developing guidelines and
protocols for animals that might become affected. In other words,
we're going to be ready."

There have been no reports of dogs who have shown signs of Ebola or
animals who have transmitted Ebola, but because Bentley is the 1st dog
exposed to the virus in the United States, vets are working with
extreme caution and treating him as if he were infected.

"We're going to treat him with exactly the same methodology that we
would with the people in a hospital with a biocontained area with
personal protective equipment and the same manner they would handle an
infected human patient," she said. "Therefore, we can assure the
public is not at risk and we can assure Bentley is taken care of in a
humane way."

Although she did not say the exact number of Texas A&M veterinary
specialists monitoring [the dog] in quarantine at Hensley Field, a
decommissioned naval air base in Dallas, she said they will all be
incorporating the philosophy behind Texas A&M's "One Health
Initiative" into their monitoring practices. One Health is a
collaboration between Texas A&M colleges that started in 2011 with the
vision of improving the overall health and sustainability of humans,
animals and the environment. "One Health refers to that inextricable
link between animal, human and environmental health," Green said.
"Bentley and his owner demonstrate this."

Spanish authorities euthanized a dog owned by an Ebola patient last
week in the interest of public safety, but specialists in Dallas are
handling the case differently. Green said A&M vets are putting One
Health to work by taking Bentley's health just as seriously as doctors
are taking [the nurse]'s in order to keep her spirits up. "It will be
better for her if she has the confidence that Bentley is being well
taken care of, too. That will make her better," she said. "We know
there are very positive health effects from the interaction between
animals and people."

Green said one of the concerns health care specialists have is that
pet owners will put their animal's well-being in front of their own
and might hesitate in reporting symptoms for fear of losing their
animal. She said the handling of Bentley will soothe those fears.

"We want to make sure Bentley is well taken care of and that people
have the confidence that if they are exposed to Ebola or show clinical
signs of Ebola that they will self-report early knowing they will not
be putting their household at risk," she said.

Green remained adamant that the public needs to know it is highly
unlikely that dogs will be at risk of transmitting the virus and that
the Texas A&M veterinarians are using this situation to learn as much
as they can about transmission and containment.

"There's a lot of unanswered questions," Green said. "Our job now is
to answer them."

Infected nurse's quarantined dog may inspire Ebola pet protocols
----------------------------------------------------------------
Bentley, the dog owned by the Ebola-stricken Texas nurse, is
apparently thriving under quarantine -- being fed, cared for and
played with by Dallas workers in full protective gear. In the process,
the cute King Charles Spaniel has become a media phenomenon, with
Twitter followers monitoring his progress through the city of Dallas
feed @100Marilla. His owner, who cared for the 1st US Ebola victim at
Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Dallas, was transferred Thursday
[16 Oct 2014] to the National Institutes of Health in Maryland. But
medical experts still are considering how to treat pets, as public
concern about the Ebola virus explodes and the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention, the American Veterinary Medical Association
and the US Department of Agriculture prepare pet protocols. In Spain,
the dog belonging to a nurse ill with Ebola was euthanized, causing an
outcry among animal lovers. The US approach has not taken that
direction and for now, the attention on the only pet so far apparently
exposed to the virus in this country has been to monitor him under the
21-day quarantine established by the CDC for humans. "He's doing well.
He's sleeping well. He's eating well," said C.C. Gonzalez-Kurz, public
information officer for the city of Dallas, which has custody of
Bentley. 

According to Christine Hoang, a veterinarian who is an assistant
director of the American Veterinary Medical Association, "We have no
known evidence that dogs will be clinically infected with the Ebola
virus." She is working with a team of government and health industry
officials to develop a protocol for dealing with future situations.
"Veterinary and public health officials should evaluate and take
appropriate protections," she said. In the case of Bentley, "basic
bio-security measures are being employed but there is no protocol
yet." Hoang said that the experts are preparing their recommendations
and the protocol could be ready as soon as next week.

It has been a difficult time for the CDC. "Studies have shown that
dogs can have an immune response to Ebola, but there have been no
reports of pet dogs or cats becoming sick with Ebola or of passing the
disease to other animals or people," said Kristen Nordlund, a CDC
health communications specialist. "In a situation where there is a dog
or cat in the home of an Ebola patient, CDC recommends public health
officials evaluate the animal's risk of exposure." One study tested
dogs during the 2001-2002 Ebola outbreak in Gabon, when some of them
were observed eating infected dead animals, according to CDC Director
Thomas Frieden. "Of the 337 dogs from various towns and villages, 9 to
25 percent showed antibodies to Ebola, a sign they were infected or
exposed to the virus," he said. Antibodies are created by the body to
fight infection but do not indicate that a virus will be transmitted.

Bentley is being cared for at Hensley Field, a former military base in
Dallas. The response from dog lovers has been so great that the city
of Dallas has joined forces with a nonprofit, Dallas Companion Animal
Project, to create a fund, the Dallas Pet Emergency Transition
Services, to help pay for the care of pets affected by emergency
events, including Ebola exposure. In a tweet Thursday [16 Oct 2014],
followers learned the latest: #Bentleyupdate! Bentley is settling in,
getting used to new routines. The cutie played w/ new toy and snuggled
w/ vet.

Questions and Answers about Ebola and Pets
------------------------------------------
The ongoing epidemic of Ebola in West Africa has raised several
questions about how the disease affects the animal population, and in
particular, the risk to household pets. While the information
available suggests that the virus may be found in several kinds of
animals, CDC, the US Department of Agriculture, and the American
Veterinary Medical Association do not believe that pets are at
significant risk for Ebola in the United States.

1. How are animals involved in Ebola outbreaks?
Because the natural reservoir host of Ebola has not yet been
confirmed, the way in which the virus 1st appears in a human at the
start of an outbreak is unknown. However, scientists believe that the
1st patient becomes infected through contact with an infected animal,
such as a fruit bat or primate (apes and monkeys), which is called a
spillover event. Person-to-person transmission follows and can lead to
large numbers of affected persons. In some past Ebola outbreaks,
primates were also affected by Ebola, and multiple spillover events
occurred when people touched or ate infected primates. In the current
West African epidemic, animals have not been found to be a factor in
ongoing Ebola transmission.

2. How does Ebola spread?
When infection occurs in humans, the virus can be spread in several
ways to others. Ebola is spread through direct contact (through broken
skin or mucous membranes in, for example, the eyes, nose, or mouth)
with blood or body fluids (including but not limited to urine, saliva,
sweat, feces, vomit, breast milk, and semen) of a person who is sick
with Ebola objects (like needles and syringes) that have been
contaminated with the virus. Ebola is not spread through the air or by
water, or in general, by food. However, in Africa, Ebola may be spread
as a result of handling bushmeat (wild animals hunted for food) and
contact with infected bats.

Only a few species of mammals (for example, humans, monkeys, and apes)
have shown the ability to become infected with and spread Ebola virus.
There is no evidence that mosquitos or other insects can transmit
Ebola virus.

3. Can dogs get infected or sick with Ebola?
At this time, there have been no reports of dogs or cats becoming sick
with Ebola or of being able to spread Ebola to people or other
animals. Even in areas in Africa where Ebola is present, there have
been no reports of dogs and cats becoming sick with Ebola. There is
limited evidence that dogs become infected with Ebola virus, but there
is no evidence that they develop disease.

4. Here in the United States, are our dogs and cats at risk of
becoming sick with Ebola?
The risk of an Ebola outbreak affecting multiple people in the United
States is very low. Therefore, the risk to pets is also very low, as
they would have to come into contact with blood and body fluids of a
person with Ebola. Even in areas in Africa where Ebola is present,
there have been no reports of dogs and cats becoming sick with Ebola.

5. Can I get Ebola from my dog or cat?
At this time, there have been no reports of dogs or cats becoming sick
with Ebola or of being able to spread Ebola to people or animals. The
chances of a dog or cat being exposed to Ebola virus in the United
States is very low as they would have to come into contact with blood
and body fluids of a symptomatic person sick with Ebola.

6. Can my pet's body, fur, or paws spread Ebola to a person?
We do not yet know whether or not a pet's body, paws, or fur can pick
up and spread Ebola to people or other animals. It is important to
keep people and animals away from blood or body fluids of a person
with symptoms of Ebola infection.

7. What if there is a pet in the home of an Ebola patient?
CDC recommends that public health officials in collaboration with a
veterinarian evaluate the pet's risk of exposure to the virus (close
contact or exposure to blood or body fluids of an Ebola patient).
Based on this evaluation as well as the specific situation, local and
state human and animal health officials will determine how the pet
should be handled.

8. Can I get my dog or cat tested for Ebola?
There would not be any reason to test a dog or cat for Ebola if there
was no exposure to a person infected with Ebola. Currently, routine
testing for Ebola is not available for pets.

9. What are the requirements for bringing pets or other animals into
the United States from West Africa?
CDC regulations require that dogs and cats imported into the United
States be healthy. Dogs must be vaccinated against rabies before
arrival into the United States. Monkeys and African rodents are not
allowed to be imported as pets under any circumstances.

Each state and US Territory has its own rules for pet ownership and
importation, and these rules may be different from federal
regulations. Airlines may have additional requirements.

10. Can monkeys spread Ebola?
Yes, monkeys are at risk for Ebola. Symptoms of Ebola infection in
monkeys include fever, decreased appetite, and sudden death. Monkeys
should not be allowed to have contact with anyone who may have Ebola.
Healthy monkeys already living in the United States and without
exposure to a person infected with Ebola are not at risk for spreading
Ebola.

11. Can bats spread Ebola?
Fruit bats in Africa are considered to be a natural reservoir for
Ebola. Bats in North America are not known to carry Ebola and so CDC
considers the risk of an Ebola outbreak from bats occurring in the
United States to be very low. However, bats are known to carry rabies
and other diseases here in the United States. To reduce the risk of
disease transmission, never attempt to touch a bat, living or dead.

12. Where can I find more information about Ebola and pet dogs and
cats?
CDC is currently working with the US Department of Agriculture, the
American Veterinary Medical Association, and many other partners to
develop additional guidance for the US pet population. Additional
information and guidance will be posted on this website as well as
partner websites as soon as it becomes available.

[According to the CDC's useful Q&A above, the only animal species
about which factual data concerning their clinical ebolavirus
infection and about their being a source for human infection is
available, are monkeys and African fruit bats. When addressing
dogs/cats, the responses are characterised by the phrases "not yet
been confirmed", "unknown", "at this time", "we do not yet know", and
finally "routine testing for Ebola is not available for pets".

A key statement is: "There is limited evidence that dogs become
infected with Ebola virus, but there is no evidence that they develop
disease". This means that the absence of clinical signs should not be
interpreted as absence of infection. There are ample examples of
species who may become non-clinical carriers of various disease
agents, including zoonotic ones. We just don't know yet if a dog or a
cat can become subclinical vectors.

The current lacuna in the scientific knowledge on the zoonotic aspects
of the Ebola and other filoviruses is alarming. Dogs have become
subject to public concerns because the 1st ex-African Ebola cases
involved pet owners; other species, within and outside the endemic
zone in Africa, should not be excluded, nor the virus' transmission
route(s) and further epidemiological data. The following abstract of a
2012 paper will serve as demonstration (see reference):

"Ebola viruses (EBOV) cause often fatal hemorrhagic fever in several
species of simian primates including human. While fruit bats are
considered natural reservoir, involvement of other species in EBOV
transmission is unclear. In 2009, Reston-EBOV was the 1st EBOV
detected in swine with indicated transmission to humans. In-contact
transmission of Zaire-EBOV (ZEBOV) between pigs was demonstrated
experimentally. Here we show ZEBOV transmission from pigs to
cynomolgus macaques without direct contact. Interestingly,
transmission between macaques in similar housing conditions was never
observed. Piglets inoculated oro-nasally with ZEBOV were transferred
to the room housing macaques in an open inaccessible cage system. All
macaques became infected. Infectious virus was detected in oro-nasal
swabs of piglets, and in blood, swabs, and tissues of macaques. This
is the 1st report of experimental interspecies virus transmission,
with the macaques also used as a human surrogate. Our finding may
influence prevention and control measures during EBOV outbreaks". 

The said paper was covered in ProMED-mail posting archive #
20121116.1412991; Mod.CP's comment therein said that "the described
experiment demonstrated the susceptibility of pigs to Zaire Ebolavirus
but aerosol transmission from pigs to primates had yet to be
demonstrated under natural environment conditions", and that "the
evidence that pigs play a role in the transmission of Ebolavirus,
other than Reston Ebolavirus, remains circumstantial". 

Mod.MHJ suggested pig's urine as source of disease to macaques. 

Have these experiments been pursued?

CDC recommends (answer 7) that "public health officials in
collaboration with a veterinarian evaluate the pet's risk of exposure
to the virus (close contact or exposure to blood or body fluids of an
Ebola patient). Based on this evaluation as well as the specific
situation, local and state human and animal health officials will
determine how the pet should be handled". This may mean that decisions
will be made on a case-by-case basis.

An update of the guidelines will be posted by ProMED-mail as soon as
it becomes available.
