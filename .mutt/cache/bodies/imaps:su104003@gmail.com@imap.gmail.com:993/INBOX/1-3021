Causal agent: Caprine arthritis/encephalitis virus
Nature of diagnosis: clinical, laboratory (basic)
This event pertains to the whole country

New outbreaks: (1)
Summary of outbreaks
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak 1: Roznowo, Chelmno, Chelminski, Kujawsko-Pomorskie
Date of start of the outbreak: 15 Sep 2014
Outbreak status: continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: farm
Affected animals:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed/ Slaughtered
Goats / 409 / 25 / 0 / 0 / 0 /

Outbreak statistics [rates apparent, expressed as percentages]
Species / Morbidity rate / Mortality rate / Case fatality rate /
Proportion susceptible animals lost*
Goats / 6.11 / 0 / 0 / 0
*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction,
and/or slaughter

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or
inconclusive
Epidemiological comments: the outbreak of caprine
arthritis/encephalitis occurred in one farm in Roznowo village in
Kujawsko-Pomorskie region.
Note by the OIE Animal Health Information Department: Since this is
the 1st time that caprine arthritis/encephalitis is identified in the
history of the country, the reason for notification as 1st occurrence
applies to the country but the event is in fact circumscribed to a
zone.

Control measures
Measures applied: no vaccination; no treatment of affected animals.
Measures to be applied: modified stamping out
Diagnostic test results:
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result

[The following information was obtained from The Center for Food
Security & Public Health, Iowa State University, fact sheet on caprine
arthritis and encephalitis at
<http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/pdfs/caprine_arthritis_encephalitis.pdf>:

"Caprine arthritis and encephalitis (CAE) is an economically important
viral disease of goats. The caprine arthritis encephalitis virus
(CAEV), a lentivirus, infects its hosts for life. Although most
infections are subclinical, a minority of animals develops
progressive, untreatable disease syndromes including polyarthritis in
adults and encephalomyelitis in kids. This virus also causes
indurative mastitis, resulting in decreased milk production. CAEV
infections decrease lifetime productivity in dairy goats, particularly
when the prevalence of infection is high within a herd. In addition,
CAEV is a barrier to the exportation of goats from countries where it
is endemic, including the United States.

"CAEV is closely related to the maedi-visna virus (MVV), which is
found most often in sheep. Although documented cases of natural
cross-species transmission are currently rare, CAEV can infect sheep
and MVV can infect goats. In Switzerland, CAEV has been re-introduced
into CAEV-free goat herds by exposure to sheep. In addition,
recombination has recently been demonstrated between MVV and CAEV.
These findings suggest that eradication programs for either
maedi-visna (ovine progressive pneumonia) or caprine arthritis and
encephalitis should now address both infections simultaneously.

"CAEV is common in dairy goats in most industrialized countries. This
virus is rarely found in the indigenous breeds of developing nations
unless they have had contact with imported goats."

OIE's internationally agreed requirements pertaining to caprine
arthritis/encephalitis are spelled out in chapter 14.1. of OIE's
Terrestrial Animal Health Code, available at
<http://www.oie.int/index.php?id=169&L=0&htmfile=chapitre_caprine_arthritis_encephalitis.htm>.

"There is no serologic or clinical evidence that humans are
susceptible to CAEV."
(<http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/pdfs/caprine_arthritis_encephalitis.pdf>).
