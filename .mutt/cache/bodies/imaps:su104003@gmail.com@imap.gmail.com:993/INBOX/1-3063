Chikungunya: epidemic stage reached in French Polynesia
-------------------------------------------------------------------
French Polynesia is now at the epidemic stage, after the 1st case of
chikungunya was revealed last Friday [10 Oct 2014], the local
government announced on Wednesday, 15 Oct [2014]. The local Health
Department identified 59 cases, and 200 were considered "suspicious".
However, only 3 patients are hospitalized for the time being.

On Friday, the government announced 1st 15 cases concentrated in a
town in the south of Tahiti. The health authorities hoped to nip in
the bud the beginning of this epidemic by destroying its vector, the
mosquito, by spraying insecticide in affected neighborhoods.

The number of cases has quadrupled
-------------------------------------------
This was not enough: not only has the number of cases quadrupled in 5
days, but other islands are now affected. Patients have reported
symptoms of chikungunya in Tubuai, Raiatea and Apataki Atoll. In
Tahiti, 11 communes of the south and east are now affected.

Chikungunya [virus infection] causes high fevers with aching joints.
In some cases, these pains and stiffness persist for several months or
even several years. The disease can be fatal in vulnerable patients,
especially the elderly.

The local Health department asked the public to "take action against
the number one enemy, the mosquito", by destroying mosquito breeding
sites. He also indicated that he had ordered a "containment P3
laboratory" to anticipate the introduction of Ebola in French
Polynesia. But given the strong international demand, this laboratory
might not be delivered for "4 or 5 months".

Chikungunya: The Taravao hospital is overwhelmed
-----------------------------------------------------------
The Chikungunya outbreak is spreading. Since Friday [10 Oct 2014] the
Taravao [Tahiti] hospital doubled its activity. More and more patients
complain of chikungunya symptoms: fever and severe joint pain. The
hospital has a hard time coping, especially because there is no cure
for chikungunya.

The hospital has increased from 30 patients a day to nearly 70. But
not all have chikungunya. There are currently 10 confirmed cases in
Taravao. But none of the patients was hospitalized. Chikungunya can
occur for 3 to 4 days only. Some people may have more serious symptoms
like nausea and never get better.

According to the Pasteur Institute, the chikungunya virus is endemic
mainly in South Asia and Africa. In 2005, a large outbreak of
chikungunya hit the Indian Ocean islands including the Isle de la
Reunion, with hundreds of thousands of reported cases. 

In 2007, the disease emerged in Europe, where the _Aedes albopictus_
vector mosquito is established. The 1st indigenous cases in the south
of France were recorded in 2010. At the end of 2013 and 2014,
chikungunya spread to the Caribbean and reached the American
continent.

Half of the population of Apataki is affected by chikungunya
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Chikungunya has hit the Apataki atoll [French Polynesia] really hard.
According to Rosalie Orbeck, mayor of this atoll in the Tuamotus, one
case occurs per day. More than half of the population would be
affected. Is this the sign of an extensive epidemic that will affect
all archipelagos?

The situation on the atoll is worrisome: "Half of the population has
been affected really fast. Every day there are people coming in, there
are already 30 confirmed laboratory cases, and still new cases keep
arriving," said Rosalie Orbeck.

How do you manage? [she was asked.]

The mayor said: "Doctors recommend to take paracetamol and drink
plenty of water. It's the only medicine that can ease the pain. The
patients who have a high fever (39 or 40 deg C) are in real pain. They
sometimes can't even walk. Some stay at home, others can make it to
the hospital. They are all lying here unable to stand up," concluded
the Mayor.

[The outbreak of chikungunya fever is spreading rapidly and
intensifying in French Polynesia. Tahiti is part of the Society Island
archipelago and capital of the collectivity that is French Polynesia.
Given the inter-island movement within French Polynesia, it is not
surprising to see chikungunya virus appear on Tahiti, the most
populous of these islands, as Zika virus did in 2013. Now, there are
suspected cases of chikungunya virus infection on Tubuai, Raiatea and
Apataki atoll. Since there are no commercially available vaccines
available yet for chikungunya virus, the only preventive measures are
vector control and avoidance of mosquito bites.

Polynesia can be accessed at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/22997>.

Tuamotu Archipelago. A map showing its location can be accessed at
